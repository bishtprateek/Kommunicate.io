					Task 5

If I have to start a software company, I would like to start it with Kushagra Joshi and Anurag Arora as my partners. This is because we are from the same class and have an 
excellent understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. Having knowing them through the years I can say that they are very hardworking and are dedicated towards work. We 
are aware of the knowledge that we each have and are able to understand and analyse each other's code very well. Also, Kushagra is a very good programmer and knows languages such 
as C++ and Python and Anurag is a full-stack web developer, and I have studied data science and machine learning. With this diverse knowledge, we would make a great team to make 
the software company successful.
