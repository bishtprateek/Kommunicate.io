Task 5

I made this project in 2nd year of my BTech, in the language C++.
This project uses header files such as <graphics.h> (to include graphics in the project)
				         <fstream.h> (used for file handling in C++)	
A contact manager is a software program that enables users to easily store and find contact information, such as names, phone numbers, etc. They are contact-centric databases that provide 
a fully integrated approach to tracking all information and communication activities linked to contacts.
This program can be used to organize an individualâ€™s details which can be used to contact that person. This program stores the names, phone numbers, and E-mail ID of a person.
The program is based on switch case. There are four cases in this program each used to perform an action on the contact.
The features of this program are:
 	Adding Contacts
 	Displaying Contacts
 	Searching Contacts
 	Deleting Contacts
